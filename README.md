# 🛠️ Software Development Roadmap 2025

Welcome to the ultimate roadmap for becoming a modern software developer in 2025.

This roadmap is crafted based on real-world experience, conversations with industry peers and leaders, and emerging trends like AI, LLMs, Agentic Systems, and Architectural Thinking.

## 📌 Why This Roadmap?

In 2025, being a solid developer goes beyond just DSA and writing APIs. The landscape now demands:

- System-level thinking  
- Architectural decision-making  
- AI awareness and integration skills  
- End-to-end product building mindset

This roadmap is designed to guide students, freshers, and early-career engineers through that journey step-by-step.

## 🧱 Phase 1: Core Programming & DSA

- Learn a backend language (Java, Python, Go, etc.)
- Master DSA: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP
- Practice on LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.
- Understand time and space complexity
- Get comfortable with Git and GitHub

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Development & Engineering

- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a frontend framework (React/Next.js)
- Build REST APIs with your chosen backend framework
- Learn SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)
- Testing: Unit, Integration, API Testing (Postman, Jest, etc.)
- Docker basics & GitHub Actions for CI/CD

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: System Design & Architectural Thinking

- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Object modeling, design patterns, SOLID principles
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Scalable systems like Instagram, Uber, etc.
- Learn about Load Balancers, Caching, Queues, Sharding
- Understand Monolith vs Microservices, Clean Architecture
- Basics of Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure, CDNs, DNS, Reverse Proxy

---

## 🤖 Phase 4: AI-Aware Development

- Understand AI/ML basics: supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Learn how LLMs work: transformers, embeddings, tokenization
- Use GPT/Claude APIs for building real-world AI features
- Explore LangChain, AutoGPT, OpenAgents
- Integrate AI into apps: Chatbots, Code Copilots, AI Assistants

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Product Thinking & Decision Making

- Understand the problem you're solving
- MVPs, feature trade-offs, cost/performance awareness
- Choose the right tech: DB, infra, design pattern, etc.
- Collaborate using agile, documentation, PRs, RFCs
- Write maintainable, scalable, and readable code

---

## 🔁 Phase 6: Continuous Growth
